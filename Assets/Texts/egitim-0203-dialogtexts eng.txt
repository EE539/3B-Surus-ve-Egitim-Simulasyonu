Welcome to the Parallel Parking training of the second training of 3D Driving and Training Simulation...
It is of great importance to look in the mirrors when parallel parking is carried out.
The car is currently specially positioned in the parallel park. Put it in reverse gear to start parking.
Turn the steering wheel completely to the right and slowly move forward until you see the first pontoon on the curb from the left mirror.
Place the car in the parking lot, turning the steering wheel to the left this time.
