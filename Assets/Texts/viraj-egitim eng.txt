Welcome to the fifth training of 3D Driving and Training Simulation...
In this tutorial, you will receive cornering training.
Brake and use the appropriate gear before turning the bend.
Entering the bend from a wide-angle is one of the most correct techniques. 
Pay attention to the tire weather and the condition of the tires. 
Continue without pressing the gas and brake until the middle of the bend. 
After the middle of the bend, complete the bend by pressing the gas.  
Pay attention to the condition of the road. Wet roads are dangerous. 
Don't try to go fast, try to go safe.
