Welcome to the third training of 3D Driving and Training Simulation...
In this training, transition priority training will be given.
A vehicle coming from the main road has the right of way when it comes to an intersection with a secondary road marking. In this case, the right of passage is yours.
Congratulations, you're doing well. If you want to continue, press N and we'll go to another area.
First, put the gear back into driving mode.
A vehicle coming from the main road has the right of way when it comes to an intersection with a secondary road marking. In this case, the right of passage belongs to the other vehicle.
Now it's your turn.
We are doing well so far. To continue, press N, and let's teleport to another area.
First, put the gear back into driving mode.
at intersections with 4 branches of the main road, the vehicle coming from the main road has the right of way when it comes to a road marked as a secondary road. So the priority is yours
Now proceed to the other part.
First, put the gear back into driving mode.
At intersections where roads of the same value meet, vehicles coming from the left must give the right of way to vehicles coming from the right.
In this case, the first sedan passes.
Secondly, Mercedes passes.
Now it is up to you.
Congrats!!! it's all right at this stage.
