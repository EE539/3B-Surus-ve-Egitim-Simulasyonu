Welcome to the first training of 3D Driving and Training Simulation...
Press the "X"/"Button 7" key to start the car.
Automatic vehicles have four gears: Drive (A), Reverse (R), Park (P), and Neutral (N). You can see which gear the car is in from the upper left panel on the screen.
When the vehicle is parked, it must be in the park (P) gear.
Neutral (N) is used when the vehicle is in the waiting position. To change the gear, press the "E"/"Button 2" key.
To proceed, we need to lower the car's handbrake and put the car in Drive (A) gear. You can lower the handbrake by pressing the "Q"/"Button 8" key and change gears by pressing the "E"/"Button 2" key.
To move the car forward, press the accelerator pedal, that is, the "W"/"Accelerator Pedal" key.
To brake, press the "Space"/"Brake Pedal" key.
The vehicle must be put into reverse gear(R) for the vehicle to move back. To change the gear, press the "E"/"Button 2" key.
After the car is stopped, we need to bring it to the Parking gear and pull the handbrake. You can change gears by pressing the "E"/"Button 2" key and pull the handbrake by pressing the "Q"/"Button 8" key.
To stop the vehicle, press the "X"/"Button 7" key.
